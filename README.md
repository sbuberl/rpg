Test game using SFML

Based on these this C++/SFML tutorial series: http://thatgamesguy.co.uk/game-engine-dev/ (https://github.com/thatgamesguy/that_game_engine)

New features:
 - Adds AnimationLoader class which loads a TexturePacker of all idle and walk animations for the main character rather than manually declarationing them all manually in the code
